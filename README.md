### Constrained RF Shimming Code
Cotains code to compute SAR constrained RF shimming optimisation as outlined in a future publication. Currently this repo includes an example data set to compute shims for an in vivo cardiac experiment for a fixed RF pulse amplitude. Soon the full computation for variable Rf pulse amplitudes will be added.
